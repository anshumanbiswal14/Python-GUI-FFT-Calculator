# Python-GUI-FFT-Calculator-using RADIX Algorithm
This is a Python GUI Application Developed by Anshuman Biswal to Perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a given Signal Sequence. 
It is written in Python 3.8 and GUI is designed in TKinter. 
Users can find DFT and IDFT of 4-Point,8-Point signal sequence in Frequency and Time Domain using Radix Algorithm, 
Also Linear Convolution and Circular Convolution using Radix Algorithm.

This program will be very useful to EEE Students who are working on a Filter Design or simply want to verify FFT answers
